Assuming that `Bundler` is installed, you can continue with the following steps:
- Step 1: Clone this repository. Just use: `git clone git@github.com:Jarfsoft/Article-page.git`.
- Step 2: Open the project folder where the repository was downloaded. Once you are in that folder, open a terminal and make sure that it will be opened in that specific folder.
- Step 3: Once you are in the terminal, just type in: `bundle install`. This will install the required dependencies for this project.
- Step 4: Type in `rails webpacker:install` to avoid a webpacker:manifest error while trying to run the project.
- Step 5: Now, you need to run the migrations. To do this, while in the project root folder type in: `rails db:migrate`.
- Step 6: Now, to try the project type in: `rails console`. You can add Users, Posts and Comments in hash form. Remember to take into account the restrictions in place for each model. You can check them out in *app/models*.
