# Ruby on Rails Article-page

> This website was developed as the capstone project for Ruby on Rails. It is a platform that can be used to post ideas for projects and attach an image to it. On the main page you can find the most voted project and below the most recent projects of each category placed in order of priority from left to right. A list of all projects created by the user can be found in a link that says "My Projects". With the "Categories" link, a list of all categories will be displayed with a thumbnail of the last added project. Choosing one will display a list of all projects assigned to the category.

> The MVC concepts of RoR have been used to provide functionality.
